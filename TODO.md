# TODO

Active work tracking. Backlog and feature requests are managed as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/justinphilpott/seed/issues).

## Doing Now

[Write what you're working on before you start. Include enough detail to resume if interrupted or context is lost. When done, use these items to write your commit message, then clear this section.]

## Next Up

- [ ] Review and align `doc-health-check` skill with the information-coverage framing in LEARNINGS.md (audits coverage, not file presence)

## Backlog

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/justinphilpott/seed/issues) for the full backlog.
