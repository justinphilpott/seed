# Agent Context for {{.ProjectName}}

{{.Description}}

## Quick Links

- [README.md](README.md) - Project overview
- [TODO.md](TODO.md) - Active work
- [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) - Key decisions
- [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) - Validated discoveries

## Working Practices

- **Small, atomic commits**: One logical change per commit. If you can't summarise it in a sentence, break it up
- **Commit early, commit often**: Working code with tests beats perfect code in progress. Small commits are easy to review, revert, and understand in git log
- **TODO.md as live context**: Before starting work, write what you're doing in TODO.md's "Doing Now" section — enough detail to resume if interrupted or context is lost. When the work is complete, derive your commit message from those items, then clear the section
- **Docs travel with code**: If a change affects how the project works, update the relevant docs in the same commit — not later
- **Check coherence before committing**: Skim project docs and verify they still agree with each other and with the code. Fix drift immediately — it compounds fast
- **Capture learnings**: When you discover something non-obvious — a gotcha, a pattern that works, a workaround — add it to LEARNINGS.md. If it's not worth writing down, it wasn't a real learning
- **Prune ruthlessly**: Replace placeholders with real content as soon as you can, or delete them. Stale scaffolding is worse than no scaffolding

## Project Constraints

[Add constraints as they emerge - e.g., dependencies, patterns, non-obvious rules]

## Key Files

[Add critical file paths and their purposes as the project grows]

## Commands

[Add build, test, and run commands as they emerge]

## Testing

[Add test conventions and how to verify changes]

## Maintaining These Docs

When adding/removing source files or changing architecture, update:
- The **Key Files** section above
- Any affected sections in linked docs
