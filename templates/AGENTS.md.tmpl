- [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) - Validated discoveries

## Working Practices

- **Small, atomic commits**: One logical change per commit. If you can't summarise it in a sentence, break it up
- **Commit early, commit often**: Working code with tests beats perfect code in progress. Small commits are easy to review, revert, and understand in git log
- **TODO.md as live context**: Before starting work, write what you're doing in TODO.md's "Doing Now" section — enough detail to resume if interrupted or context is lost. When the work is complete, derive your commit message from those items, then clear the section
- **Docs travel with code**: If a change affects how the project works, update the relevant docs in the same commit — not later
- **Check coherence before committing**: Skim project docs and verify they still agree with each other and with the code. Fix drift immediately — it compounds fast
- **Capture learnings**: When you discover something non-obvious — a gotcha, a pattern that works, a workaround — add it to LEARNINGS.md. If it's not worth writing down, it wasn't a real learning
- **Prune ruthlessly**: Replace placeholders with real content as soon as you can, or delete them. Stale scaffolding is worse than no scaffolding
- **Entropy guard**: Before committing non-trivial work, run `skills/entropy-guard.md` in full — don't shortcut it. It ensures the project's docs remain coherent and self-referential with what was just built

## Project Constraints

[Add constraints as they emerge - e.g., dependencies, patterns, non-obvious rules]

## Key Files

[Add critical file paths and their purposes as the project grows]

## Commands

[Add build, test, and run commands as they emerge]
{{if .IncludeDevContainer}}
## Dev Container

This project includes a devcontainer. Before opening in VS Code, authenticate `gh` on your host so it is available inside the container:

```bash
# If you use gh auth login (OAuth):
export GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)

# If you use a personal access token directly:
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_yourtoken
```

Then open the project in VS Code and select **Reopen in Container**. Both `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` (for Codespaces/CI) are forwarded automatically.

## Testing

[Add test conventions and how to verify changes]

## Maintaining These Docs

When adding/removing source files or changing architecture, update:
- The **Key Files** section above
- Any affected sections in linked docs

## Scaffolding Feedback

This project was scaffolded by [seed](https://github.com/justinphilpott/seed). Two skills support the feedback loop:

- `seed-ux-eval` — evaluate the scaffolding quality early, before the project has real content. Run this when you first open the project.
- `seed-feedback` — file a specific observation back to seed once you've identified something concrete to improve.
