# TODO

Lightweight task tracking for early development. Graduate to an issue tracker (GitHub Issues, Linear, etc.) once the project has momentum.

## Doing Now

[Write what you're working on before you start. Include enough context to resume if interrupted. When done, use these items to write your commit message, then clear this section.]

## Next Up

- [ ] Fill in the Goal section in README.md — what are you validating?

## Backlog

[Keep tasks small and concrete — if one needs multiple commits, break it down]
